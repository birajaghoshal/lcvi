### Abstract

Bayesian decision theory outlines a rigorous framework for making optimal decisions based on maximizing expected utility over a model posterior. However, practitioners often do not have access to the full posterior and resort to approximate inference strategies. In such cases, taking the eventual decision-making task into account while performing the inference allows for calibrating the posterior approximation to maximizethe utility. We present an automatic pipeline that co-opts continuous utilities into variational inference algorithms to account for decision-making. We provide practical strategies for approximating and maximizing gain, and empirically demonstrate consistent improvement when calibrating approximations for specific utilities.

### Data

Last.fm data can be found in *data* directory. The main file is lastfm_data.csv. 
The data was extracted using *data/lastfm_data_preparation.ipynb*.


### Pre-installation Requirements

The code was tested using Python 3.6 from Anaconda 2018.*.
It requires PyTorch 1.0, numpy, pandas, pystan, seaborn, and matplotlib to be preinstalled.


### Experiments

Experiments are placed in *experiments* directory.
Additional details can be found in *experiments/README.txt*.
For each of the experiments, we provide the intermediate results that 
were used to create plots using REPORT*.ipynb Jupyter notebooks. 
Thanks to that, additional plots/processing can be achieved 
without running full experiments.
